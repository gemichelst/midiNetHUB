### column($ratios: 1, $offset: 0, $cycle: 0, $gutter: map-get($jeet, 'gutter'), $nth: map-get($jeet, 'nth'))

Specify an initial ratio, either as fractions or decimals, then pass the parent container's context ratio to maintain consistent gutters as you nest.

Specify a ratio to make your offset have a margin-left. Make it negative to give it a margin-right instead. E.g. `column(1/4, $offset: 1/4)` would create a column the quarter of the size of its container and push it to the right a quarter.

Understanding `cycle` is important. Want to make a gallery but don't want to have a `<div class="row">` every 4 pictures? `column(1/4, $cycle: 4)` - done.

Want to change it up when you get down to mobile? Maybe just show 2 images per row? `column(1/2, $cycle: 2)` - done.

Need to adjust column gutters for a specific container? `col(1/4, $gutter: .5)`. Note the gutter isn't a fixed width.

The `nth` parameter allow you to switch betweet `nth-child` and `nth-of-type` when building the
grid. `nth-child` is the default rule. The accepted values are `child` or `type`.

### column-width($ratios: 1, $gutter: map-get($jeet, 'gutter'))

A function to return strictly the column width with none of the styles.

### column-gutter($ratios: 1, $gutter: map-get($jeet, 'gutter'))

A function that returns the gutter size.

### span($ratio: 1, $offset: 0, $cycle: 0, $nth: map-get($jeet, 'nth'))

Need a grid without the gutters? For instance, for a horizontal navigation where you want buttons touching. Do so with `span(1/5)`. No need to pass more than one ratio since we don't need to worry about the math involved with gutters and all that.

### move($ratios: 0, $col-or-span: column, $gutter: map-get($jeet, 'gutter'))

Source ordering works in Jeet by assigning `position: relative` and then a `left` offset equal to the ratio passed.

You can specify if this is a column or span movement to include gutters or not. This works similar to `offset` in that it can accept negative values to shift the other direction.

`move` can accept multiple context ratios to maintain perfect nested sizing. `move` also accepts custom gutter sizing, just make sure your gutter sizes match the gutter sizes of your original elements.

### unmove()

Accepts no values. `unmove()` is a great helper function to quickly disable whatever source ordering you've done to an element.

### debug($color: blue, $important: false)

Debug mode assigns a lightly translucent background to every element on the page. It's a little trick picked up over the years that makes visualizing the structure of your site trivial.

### center($max-width: map-get($jeet, 'max-width'), $pad: 0)

This is a shortcut to easily center containers. The pad variable sets padding on the left and right.

### uncenter()

Resets styles associated with `center()`.

### stack($pad: 0, $align: false)

A helper mixin to "stack" elements on top of each other. Useful for mobile views. Accepts padding and/or text alignment.

### unstack()

Cancel that `stack()`. This won't revert back to your `column()` calls. For that, manually call your `column()` method again.

### align($direction: both)

Aligning blocks relative to their container (so their parent container needs `position: relative`) with `position: absolute` and fancy positioning and transform. Vertical alignment is now trivial in IE9+ browsers.

### clearfix()

A simple/kinda-modern clearfix. Use this to wrap any set of `column()`s or `span()`s. If you need super-old browser support, you can create your own clearfix mixin (use the `clearfix` namespace) with stuff like `:before` and `*zoom: 1` (look up an old clearfix).
