# Jeet 7.0.0 is here!

[Jeet](http://jeet.gs) is a simple fractional grid system for **[Sass](scss)** and **[Stylus](styl)**.

Learn the [API](docs) in minutes and begin tossing together grids.

Check this out:

```fish
npm install -D jeet
```

```scss
@import 'node_modules/jeet/jeet';

.container {
  @include center();
}

.container div {
  @include column(1/3);
}
```

Jeet functions accept fractions (or float numbers) and generates a percentage width and gutter for grids. We're able to do this while maintaining a consistently-sized, infinitely-nestable, gutter (so long as you provide the parent element's fraction as context).

The API is documented in Sass, but we've worked hard to make the API *very* similar in both preprocessors. `@include column(1/2);` in SCSS would be `column(1/2)` in Stylus, ya dig?
